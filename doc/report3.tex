This is the report for Lab2 assignemt for Advance Memory Systems (ECE-7103A) taught by Moinuddin Qureshi on Spring 2015. This assignment is about cache replacement policies. In this assignment three new policies is implemented and their metrics are compared with each other. Also, their results is compared with traditional cache replacement policies like LRU and Random. The policies that are implemented are DRRIP\cite{rrip} and SHiP-PC\cite{ship} plus another replacement policy based on student's preference. These policies are tested with a set of Spec2006 benchmarks. The system for the experiments is a 4-core out-of-order CMP (Chip Multiprocessor) with three level of cache. Our policy is implemented on a 4~MB set-associative Last Level Cache (LLC). The metrics we used are number of misses and Cycles Per Instruction (CPI). The rest of details could be find in the report.
